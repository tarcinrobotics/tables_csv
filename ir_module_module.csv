You can send emails\nfrom Odoo itself, and that too with great possibilities. For example,\ndesign a beautiful email template for the invoices, and use the same\nfor all your customers, no need to do the same exercise every time.\n\nChatter\n-------\nDo all the contextual conversation on a document. For example on an\napplicant, directly post an update to send email to the applicant,\nschedule the next interview call, attach the contract, add HR officer\nto the follower list to notify them for important events(with help of\nsubtypes),...\n\n\nRetrieve incoming email on POP/IMAP servers.\n============================================\nEnter the parameters of your POP/IMAP account(s), and any incoming emails on\nthese accounts will be automatically downloaded into your Odoo system. All\nPOP3/IMAP-compatible servers are supported, included those that require an\nencrypted SSL/TLS connection.\nThis can be used to easily create email-based workflows for many email-enabled Odoo documents, such as:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    * CRM Leads/Opportunities\n    * CRM Claims\n    * Project Issues\n    * Project Tasks\n    * Human Resource Recruitment (Applicants)\nJust install the relevant application, and you can assign any of these document\ntypes (Leads, Project Issues) to your incoming email accounts. New emails will\nautomatically spawn new documents of the chosen type, so it's a snap to create a\nmailbox-to-Odoo integration. Even better: these documents directly act as mini\nconversations synchronized by email. You can reply from within Odoo, and the\nanswers will automatically be collected when they come back, and attached to the\nsame *conversation* document.\nFor more specific needs, you may also assign custom-defined actions\n(technically: Server Actions) to be triggered for each incoming mail.\n""}",t,f,f,LGPL-3,145,f,f,,,,,"Discuss

Las NIIF completas y la NIIF PYMES no\ncontienen prescripciones sobre teneduría de libros, y consecuentemente, sobre los libros y otros registros\nde naturaleza contable. Por otro lado, si bien es cierto la contabilidad es también un insumo, dentro de otros, para\nlabores de cumplimiento tributario, este PCGE no ha sido elaborado para satisfacer prescripciones tributarias ni su\nverificación. No obstante ello, donde no hubo oposición entre la contabilidad financiera prescrita por las NIIF y\nla legislación tributaria, este PCGE ha incluido subcuentas, divisionarias y sub divisionarias, para\ndistinguir componentes con validez tributaria, dentro del conjunto de componentes que corresponden a una\nperspectiva contable íntegramente.

Different companies may have different\nLDAP servers, as long as they have unique usernames (usernames need to be unique\nin Odoo, even across multiple companies).\n\nAnonymous LDAP binding is also supported (for LDAP servers that allow it), by\nsimply keeping the LDAP user and password empty in the LDAP configuration.\nThis does not allow anonymous authentication for users, it is only for the master\nLDAP account that is used to verify if a user exists before attempting to\nauthenticate it.\n\nSecuring the connection with STARTTLS is available for LDAP servers supporting\nit, by enabling the TLS option in the LDAP configuration.\n\nFor further options configuring the LDAP settings, refer to the ldap.conf\nmanpage: manpage:`ldap.conf(5)`.\n\nSecurity Considerations:\n------------------------\nUsers' LDAP passwords are never stored in the Odoo database, the LDAP server\nis queried whenever a user needs to be authenticated. No duplication of the\npassword occurs, and passwords are managed in one place only.\n\nOdoo does not manage password changes in the LDAP, so any change of password\nshould be conducted by other means in the LDAP directory directly (for LDAP users).\n\nIt is also possible to have local Odoo users in the database along with\nLDAP-authenticated users (the Administrator account is one obvious example).\n\nHere is how it works:\n---------------------\n    * The system first attempts to authenticate users against the local Odoo\n      database;\n    * if this authentication fails (for example because the user has no local\n      password), the system then attempts to authenticate against LDAP;\n\nAs LDAP users have blank passwords by default in the local Odoo database\n(which means no access), the first step always fails and the LDAP server is\nqueried to do the authentication.\n\nEnabling STARTTLS ensures that the authentication query to the LDAP server is\nencrypted.\n\nUser Template:\n--------------\nIn the LDAP configuration on the General Settings, it is possible to select a *User\nTemplate*. If set, this user will be used as template to create the local users\nwhenever someone authenticates for the first time via LDAP authentication. This\nallows pre-setting the default groups and menus of the first-time users.\n\n**Warning:** if you set a password for the user template, this password will be\n         assigned as local password for each new LDAP user, effectively setting\n         a *master password* for these users (until manually changed). You\n         usually do not want this. One easy way to setup a template user is to\n         login once with a valid LDAP user, let Odoo create a blank local\n         user with the same login (and a blank password), then rename this new\n         user to a username that does not exist in LDAP, and setup its groups\n""}",f,f,f,LGPL-3,100,f,f,,,,,"","","",official,
